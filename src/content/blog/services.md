Here is a list of services that are provided by DAMAX Auto
<br>

## Pre-purchase car inspection

We recommend an independent inspection when you're thinking about buying a used car, even if the seller tells you the car is in good condition and already certified.
A preliminary inspection can help you save money later on when using your vehicle. Bring the car you want to buy to us for inspection. We will provide you with a second opinion and help you make the right choice.

## Safety Inspections

A safety standards certificate shows that your vehicle meets Ontario's vehicle safety standards.
You can't put a license plate on a vehicle without one. 
We'll inspect your vehicle to ensure it's safe and ready for the road.

## Service Maintenance

Regular vehicle maintenance helps prevent costly and unpleasant breakdowns.
We recommend regularly changing engine oil, filters, technical fluids, and conducting a full check of the condition of all vehicle components

## Computer Diagnostics

Latest model cars are equipped with an on-board computer that controls all components.
When the host computer detects a problem, an indicator light comes on on the instrument panel.
We recommend immediately contacting specialists to find out the cause and promptly fix the problem.

## Suspension

The suspension is part of the chassis, which includes the frame, steering and wheels.
Most suspension systems are made up of several parts (springs, shock absorbers, struts, torsion bars, leaf springs, links, air springs, etc.) that connect the vehicle to its wheels.
The good condition of your car's suspension is responsible not only for comfort, but also for safety during the trip.

## Brake System

Regular brake maintenance and adjustments are very important. Without a well-functioning braking system, you will be unable to stop your vehicle, putting the safety of you, your passengers, and those around you at risk.

## Engine and transmission 

Some of the most important elements in your car. Unfortunately, incorrect and untimely maintenance leads to problems with the engine or transmission. We can diagnose, repair and replace these elements.
Tires 
Seasonal change, balancing, tire repair, purchase assistance

## Electronics 

Installation of additional equipment

## Exhaust system

The exhaust system includes a manifold, a flexible part, an exhaust gas analyzer, a catalytic converter that burns harmful gases, and a pipe with a sound-absorbing muffler. If one part of the exhaust system fails, it needs to be replaced.

## Wheel alignment

Poor wheel alignment can cause uneven and rapid tire wear. It is recommended to adjust the wheel alignment after replacing spare parts in the steering system, as well as after replacing tires

## Body protection

Our rustproofing process uses a dripless oil, safe on all plastic and rubber components. For your first application, we disassemble the plastic covers and liners reaching hard to access areas for thorough coverage. We recommend coming back every two years to re-coat all exposed areas.

## Parts sales

We use OEM or quality replacement parts for your vehicle to meet your needs and budget. We always try to find the best prices for spare parts and accessories.
